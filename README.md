## Horizon Trade Notifier  
Horizon is a Python trade notifier for Roblox, which will send custom-themed image notifications to discord webhooks.  
  
Horizon boasts an impressive range of features, including custom-built images at runtime adapting to detected trade data, easily adaptable theme configuration, and much more. 
Horizon's configurable themes is it's most impressive feature, making it easy for anyone to make a beautiful notification suited to what they like.  
Ontop of this, Horizon has [maintained documentation](https://github.com/JartanFTW/Trade-Notifier/wiki) available on the Wiki tab of [repository](https://github.com/JartanFTW/Trade-Notifier), including but not limited to a quick tutorial on how to setup Horizon, along with explanations of all the customization options Horizon offers.  
  
Horizon works via an input ROBLOX .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, allowing Horizon to access a users trade data to send notifications based on.  
Horizon is most frequently used by traders looking for an easy way to be alerted when they receive a trade, but don't want to be refreshing a website every 30 seconds. The goal of Horizon is to give users an easy solution without any hassle or highly demanding hardware usage.  
  
## Where to start  
Horizon is compatible with both Windows and Linux, although the setup is slightly different.  
Check out the [Quickstart page on the Wiki](https://github.com/JartanFTW/Trade-Notifier/wiki/Quickstart) for details on how to get Horizon setup for Windows.  
For Linux, it's a similar process to Windows but Python must be installed and used with the Horizon source code, instead of the executable. To install all third party Python dependencies required by Horizon, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the Horizon directory.   
  
## How you can help
If you would like to contribute to Horizon's development, there are a variety of things you can do.  
1. Report bugs! We can't fix issues with Horizon that we don't know exist. We prefer you make a [bug report in the issues tab](https://github.com/JartanFTW/Trade-Notifier/issues) however letting us know in Discord is always fine too!  
2. Request features! While Horizon is at this point a fully fleshed out program, we're always looking for great new ideas to implement. If you have an idea for a feature, create a [feature request in the repository](https://github.com/JartanFTW/Trade-Notifier/issues) and let us know! A Discord message is always acceptable too :)
